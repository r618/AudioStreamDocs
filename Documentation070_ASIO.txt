ASIO on Windows:
================================================================================

	When enabled via 'Asio' checkbox on 'AudioStream\Scripts\Resources\DevicesConfiguration' Scriptable Object
	all sounds/resources created by the asset on Windows use a special ASIO enabled system - (this includes "all" input and output functionality)

	Settings for output #0 configured here also apply for ASIO, except its buffers which are configured separately:
	'ASIO buffer Size'	must match ASIO config (see below)
	'ASIO buffer Count'	is set to 4 by default (you can try lower values)

	// max. number of speakers is 32
	// see also 'Devices config' in Documentation.txt

	ASIO was tested w/
		FlexASIO [https://github.com/dechamps/FlexASIO/releases] driver, and configured via 
		FlexASIO_GUI [https://github.com/flipswitchingmonkey/FlexASIO_GUI/releases]

	ASIO config is rather sensitive, so you should try various combinations suitable for your system.
	Example configuration of FlexASIO which worked while developing it:

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Backend:						Windows DirectSound
	Set Buffer Size					On
	Buffer Size						e.g. 256 ('ASIO buffer Size' on DevicesConfiguration has to match)
	Input Device					pick one
	Output Device					pick one
	Latency
		Set Input Latency			On
		Input Latency				0.1
		Set Output Latency			On
		Output Latency				0.1

	WASAPI
		Input
			Set						On
			Exclusive				On
			AutoConvert				Off
		Output						On
			Set Exclusive			Off
			AutoConvert				Off

	Channels
		- set correct # of input and output channels for devices selected above
	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

	Save to Default FlexASIO.toml
	- this config will be picked up by FlexASIO when running a scene which uses one of the AudioStream's components with ASIO enabled.

	It *might* work with other ASIO driver(s), but it was tested primarily with the above.

	ASIO-enabled systems might not be fully stable when using 'Output devices' (AudioSourceOutputDevice, MediaSourceOutputDevice) components,
	though it makes little sense to use them, since there are only 1 input and 1 output devices configured as per above
	- the asset doesn't take any assumptions about underlying devices though and should be working in general with any inputs/outputs should it be possible to configure them

	An example with
		ASIO buffer 256 b large, 2 buffers is computed total latency on AudioStreamInput2D component in demo scene is 10.66 ms
		with 128, 2 buffers is total latency 5.33 ms

	--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	Audio Mixer effect:
	- it currently had little sense for the mixer plugin to be using ASIO driver since there are no devices/outputs to redirect the audio to
	given just 1 input and output (see above), so it is unchanged and currently always using normal FMOD autodetected output type.
